# Overview

## The Challenge:

    The challenge is to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.

## User Story

```md

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
- Use React for the front end.

- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (JWT).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Application Info:

```md

```

## Installation Instructions:

Step 1: Clone repository.
<br>
Step 2: Install Nodejs.
<br>
Step 3: Install a source-code editor like VsCode.
<br>
Step 4: Nodemon is recommended in order to refresh and see updated notes data.

## Usage Instructions

Step 1: Open VsCode(preferred) or another source-code editor if not already running.
<br>
Step 2: Open integrated terminal once in the main folder.
<br>
Step 3: "run npm i" / "sudo npm i" in the terminal to install the required dependencies.
<br>
Step 4: Now to run the application, Enter "npm run build" and then "npm run start", or just "npm run develop" for development.
<br>
Step 5: After the "VITE v5.2.10 ready in 267 ms" appears in the console, open the local host URL that's displayed in the console if you haven't automatically directed to the application.

## Test Instructions:

For testing and debugging, the application logs requests and errors in the console. Unit testing not configured. For further debugging feel free to check the sources in Dev Tools for front-end and JavaScript Debug Terminal for backend.
