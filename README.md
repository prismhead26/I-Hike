# Overview

## The Challenge:

The challenge is to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.

## User Story

```md
As a existing user or new user,
I want to be able to login/create an account, so I can have full access to the I-Hike site.
I want to enter in a city in the search bar on the homepage, so I can get a map of nearby trails.
I want to click on the Marker in the map and view the trail, so I can then be redirected to the specific trail page displaying a map, trail info, and directions.
I want to have the ability to add the trail to my favorite or future hikes list, so I can view my hikes via the myHikes page with the ability to also remove said hikes.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
- Use React for the front end.

- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (JWT).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Application Info:

```md
In a world where technology often keeps us indoors, iHike was created by two programmers with a passion to reconnect with nature and the great outdoors for everyone. We recognized a gap in the market for an all-encompassing hiking app that caters to all adventuring hikers, whether their skill level is beginner, intermediate, or seasoned adventurists.

Understandably, finding hiking trail information can be a daunting task, especially in unfamiliar land areas. This challenge often deters people from exploring new hikes and enjoying the physical and mental health benefits that come with spending time in nature. With iHike, we aim to make the discovery of new trails as simple and accessible as possible. By allowing users to input their city and instantly access a curated list of nearby hikes, complete with detailed descriptions, and difficulty levels, we provide a seamless solution.

iHike is more than just an app; it’s a gateway to adventure, health, and a deeper appreciation for the natural landscape around us. Our motivation is to empower people to explore the beauty around them, build connections with fellow hikers, and make every hike a memorable and enriching experience. Join us on this journey and let iHike be your guide to the great outdoors.

Your path to adventure starts here!
